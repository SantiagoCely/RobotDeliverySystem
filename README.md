# Autonomous Food Delivery Robot (in progress) 

Following the pandemic, many restaurant owners are still struggling financially due to customers not feeling comfortable going out and service workers are continually put in dangerous situations  to COVID19. At the same time, labour shortage sparked by the pandemic is expected to grow as the population ages. It is in this context that we decided to build an food delivery robot system.
